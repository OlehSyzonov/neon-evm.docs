This page details setting up a Hardhat configuration file. 

## Introduction

<WhatHardHat/>

The Hardhat framework isn't described here; find that in the [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview). This tutorial is based on an [example in GitHub](https://github.com/neonlabsorg/neon-tutorials/tree/main/hardhat).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure the following software is installed on your device:
-  `NodeJS v8.9.4` or later
- `Web3 v1.2.0` or later[
- An EVM-compatible wallet such as [MetaMask](wallet/metamask_setup.md#installing-metamask):
  - Configured for a [Neon EVM network](/docs/developing/connect_rpc#connect-via-chainlist)
  - Balance to cover gas fees

## Network configuration

- [Solana cluster](https://docs.solana.com/clusters) is accessed via a proxy.
- Solana works in test mode and the proxy interacts with it through Neon EVM.

## The Hardhat configuration file

<ConfigHardHat/>

:::info
The deployer wallet address needs to have enough tokens to cover the gas cost of the deployment. 

- [Get Devnet NEON](https://neonfaucet.org/)
:::

The following is a full example, configured for the example below, of the `hardhat.config.js` configuration file for connecting Hardhat to a devnet-proxy using the one-way library on Node.js:

##### hardhat.config.js

```js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");

const proxy_url = 'https://devnet.neonevm.org';
const network_id = 245022926;

// Private keys for test accounts
// NOTE: Replace these placeholders with your own and make sure the accounts have non-zero NEON balances
const privateKeys = [
  "0xPLACEHOLDER1",
  "0xPLACEHOLDER2"
];

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  defaultNetwork: 'neonlabs',
  networks: {
    neonlabs: {
      url: proxy_url,
      accounts: privateKeys,
      network_id: network_id,
      chainId: network_id,
      allowUnlimitedContractSize: false,
      timeout: 1000000,
      isFork: true
    }
  }
};
```

The parameters for `module.exports` include:
* `solidity`: version of Solidity used
* `defaultNetwork`: 'neonlabs'
* `networks`:
  * `neonlabs`:
    * `url`: proxy URL
    * `accounts`: an array of deployer's private keys
    * `network_id`: the network's network ID
    * `chainId`: the network's chain ID

Note that `proxy_url`, `network_id`, and `chainId` can be retrieved from the RPC endpoints table and/or [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/).
